# Redirector

This repository holds three things:

1. [`data/transition-sites`](data/transition-sites) - Configuration for sites being redirected to GOV.UK. This configuration is automatically loaded into the [Transition app](https://github.com/alphagov/transition)
2. [`tld/`](tld/) - _Deprecated._ These are nginx configuration files which redirect from root domains which previously couldn't be pointed at our CDN to subdomains which could be. Root domains should now be configured as aliases and pointed at our CDN IP addresses instead:
  * 23.235.33.144
  * 23.235.37.144
3. [`tools/`](tools/) - Miscellaneous scripts for updating tna_timstamps, configuring root domain redirects and generating mappings.

## Sites

Each site is configured using a yaml file in the `data/transition-sites` directory:

Required:
* `whitehall_slug` — the slug used in Whitehall for the organisation which owns the site. Used for branding in Bouncer and access control in Transition.
* `site` — friendly name for the site
* `host` — primary hostname for site
* `tna_timestamp` — timestamp of the last good National Archives capture. eg 20131002172858
* `homepage` — URL for new site, used to redirect '/'. Must include the 'http' or 'https'.

Optional:
* `homepage_title` — site title for 404/410 pages. Defaults to organisation title. Should fit into the sentence: "Visit the new [title] site at [furl or homepage]"
* `extra_organisation_slugs` — additional organisations which own this site. Used for access control in Transition.
* `homepage_furl` — friendly URL displayed on 404/410 pages. Should redirect to the `homepage`. Doesn't need to include 'http' or 'https'.
* `aliases` — list of alias domains
* `global` — set a global redirect or archive for all paths
* `css` — a css class which determines the logo and brand colour used on 404/410 pages
* `options` — used to list significant querystrings for canonicalisation like this: `--query-string first:second:third`. A significant querystring is one which on the old website changes the content in a meaningful way - which we might therefore need to map to a different place.
* `global_redirect_append_path` — should the path the user supplied be appended
to the URL for the global redirect?
* `special_redirect_strategy` — when the transition is partial, some tools or content will be left behind and managed by the previous supplier. This setting can be one of:
    * `via_aka` - the supplier is redirecting some paths to our aka domain.
    * `supplier` - the supplier is managing redirects to gov.uk. No traffic comes through Bouncer for this site.

Use `rake new_site[abbr,whitehall_slug,host]` to create a new site, with an option for which service to config e.g.

`rake new_site[ukba,uk-border-agency,www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk]`

## Assets

We continue to serve some pages and assets for Directgov and BusinessLink sites. These are
stored in GitHub and served by Bouncer's nginx configuration. See:
* [assets-directgov](https://github.com/alphagov/assets-directgov)
* [assets-businesslink](https://github.com/alphagov/assets-businesslink)
* [Bouncer's nginx configuration](https://github.gds/gds/puppet/blob/master/modules/govuk/manifests/apps/bouncer.pp#L28-L119)

Bouncer's nginx configuration also includes a small number of redirects and
other behaviours not possible with mappings.
