# Transition Sites

This is seed data for the Transition/Bouncer app which is never intended to be
served by Redirector.

Transition already has code for importing Redirector data, and this is a
reasonable place to put it that decouples data from deploys, allows peer review
and avoids proliferation of repositories. It is intended that Transition will
one day have UI for creating and editing all of this data, making this
redundant.
